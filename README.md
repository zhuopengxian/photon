Physicists have been searched for elementary particle of matter. But what is elementary? People find it hard to answer this question. From china ancient books--The Book of Changes, we know that Taiji produces two Yi. Two Yi produce four quadrant, four quadrant produce eight diagrams. Eight diagrams produce all the things in the universe. Grand means endless. But the taiji is the great void, isn’t it that ZERO matter? We know that photon’s rest mass is zero. If the ZERO matter is photon, isn’t it that photon is “the ultimate elementary particle of matter”? We know that infinitesimal limit is zero. If so, isn’t it that ultimate elementary particle of matter is photon?
