Physicists have been searched for elementary particle of 
    matter. B</span>u<span lang="EN-US">t what is elementary? People find it hard to answer this question. 
    From china ancient books--The Book of Changes, we know that Taiji 
    produces two Yi. Two Yi produce four quadrant, four quadrant 
    produce eight diagrams. Eight diagrams produce all the things in the 
    universe. Grand means endless. But the taiji is the great void, isn’t 
    it that ZERO matter? We know that photon’s rest mass is zero. If the ZERO 
    matter is photon, isn’t it that photon is “the ultimate elementary particle 
    of matter”? We know that infinitesimal limit is zero. If so, isn’t it that 
    ultimate elementary particle of matter is photon?</span></font></span></span><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10.5pt">
